### Development

Install the [tsconfig.json CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tsconfig.json) to preview changes locally. To install:

```
npm i -g tsconfig.json
```

Run at the root of your documentation (where config.json is)

```
tsconfig.json dev
```

### Publishing Changes

Install our Github App to auto propagate changes. Changes will be deployed to production automatically after pushing to the default branch. Find the link to install on your dashboard. 

#### Troubleshooting

- tsconfig.json dev isn't running - Run `tsconfig.json install` to re-install dependencies.
- Page loads as a 404 - Make sure you are running in a folder with `config.json`
